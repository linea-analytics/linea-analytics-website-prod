        <h1>Comparing Robyn vs. Meridian: What open source MMM is best for me?</h1>
        <h2>Rise of open source MMM measurement</h2>
        <p>It&#39;s been 2 years since the launch of Meta’s Robyn MMM &amp; Google MMM Meridian. They both provide a
          free-to-use way for brands to run incremental, focused Marketing Mix modelling. </p>
        <p>The aim of these tools is to allow Brands to measure what&#39;s driving their sales. With a focus on
          controlling for key marketing factors, including price, promotions and most importantly, the impact of media.
        </p>
        <p>The rise of these tools has coincided with two key trends:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduction in the <strong>accuracy of attribution techniques</strong>. Walled gardens, removal of cookies
            and more users opting out of tracking have reduced the quality of data in attribution techniques </li>
          <li>A need for non-cookie-based tracking. MMM is a statistical approach rather than a deterministic method
          </li>
          <li>Desire to measure performance media alongside brand media (or mid/upper funnel)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why use open-source tools like Robyn MMM or Meridian MMM?</h2>
        <p>Whilst MMM is not a new approach, it has been used for 15 years. Robyn MMM and Meridian MMM are <a
            href="https://linea-analytics.com/articles/robyn-meridian/article.html"><strong>free to use</strong></a>,
          fully customisable to your needs and come documented with the backing of respected Tech companies in Meta
          &amp; Google. </p>
        <p>To successfully implement an MMM programme you need to solve three things. </p>
        <p> <strong>X</strong> Data set up<br>✅Run model &amp; analysis<br> <strong>X</strong> Take action from
          measurement</p>
        <p>With open source models, solving the “running a model” part. Many MMM providers, like <a
            href="https://linea-analytics.com/">ourselves at Linea</a>, are set up to ensure that a brand can solve all
          of the areas, including data ingestion &amp; taking action from measurement. </p>
        <p>So when working with open source models, teams need to ensure that all of these aspects are solved for.</p>

        <h2>Key features of Robyn MMM</h2>
        <p>Meta’s <strong>Robyn</strong> uses <em>ridge regression</em> as its core modelling engine. This provides
          stability and robustness when dealing with many correlated marketing variables. Ridge regression applies a
          regularisation penalty that can prevent overfitting and ensure more realistic, interpretable media effects.
        </p>
        <p>This makes it particularly effective for marketing mix modelling, where channels often move together and
          avoids allocating too much credit to correlated spend patterns.</p>
        <p>In addition, Robyn integrates <strong>time-series decomposition</strong>, automatically controlling for
          underlying business baselines such as long-term trend, seasonality, and holiday effects. This separation
          ensures that the regression focuses on the incremental contribution of media, not fluctuations caused by
          recurring calendar or market dynamics, a key feature of MMM. </p>
        <h2>Key features of Meridian MMM</h2>
        <p>Google’s <strong>Meridian</strong> stands out for its explicit integration of <em>reach and frequency
            modelling</em>, especially for video and YouTube channels. Instead of relying solely on spend or
          impressions, it measures how many unique users were actually reached and how often they were exposed to an ad.
          This allows the model to distinguish between incremental reach (new audiences) and repeated exposure
          (frequency), which offers a unique way of measuring the effectiveness of YouTube. By doing so, Meridian
          captures diminishing returns more realistically, revealing how additional exposures contribute less marginal
          impact once audience saturation occurs.</p>
        <p>Equally important is Meridian’s <strong>Bayesian framework</strong>, which allows the incorporation of prior
          knowledge, such as results from experiments or past campaigns, directly into the model. This approach
          generates full probability distributions for ROI estimates, rather than single point values. This provides a
          richer insight into uncertainty and confidence - a crucial aspect of MMM. The Bayesian framework also performs
          well with limited or noisy data, as priors can guide the model towards plausible results. </p>
        <h2>Robyn &amp; Meridian Optimisation: Taking action from measurement</h2>
        <p>One of the key challenges we have seen from teams building MMM in Robyn or Meridian is trusting the results
          and taking action from the analysis. </p>
        <p>Teams, when running an MMM, need to focus on what the core question(s) they are trying to answer. Typically,
          it&#39;s three things:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>How much am I paying back for each marketing channel (cross-channel effectiveness) </li>
          <li>How do I allocate my next month, quarter or year budget between channels? </li>
          <li>How much do I spend to hit my targets?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Having used both Robyn &amp; Meridian optimisation tools, we have found that their functionality is lacking.
          The existing optimisation features for Robyn &amp; Meridian are slow to run, don’t take into account many
          “what if” factors that may come up and, crucially, it’s not possible to be run by marketing teams. </p>
        <p>That&#39;s why we have built the <strong><a href="https://linea-analytics.com/scenario-tool-mmm">Linea Scenario Tool</a></strong>. It’s built on top of your Robyn or
          Meridian models and is specifically designed to handle complex Robyn or Meridian optimisation challenges. The
          tool runs quickly and is easy for data scientists <strong>or marketing teams</strong> to use. To ensure that
          teams can take action from there, Robyn or Meridian MMM, it is built with a flexible level of functionality to
          ensure teams can run multiple “what if” scenarios. </p>

        <h2>In Summary</h2>
        <p>Both Robyn and Meridian MMM tools have changed the game on measurement. In-house teams, Media agencies &amp;
          many others use these as a gateway into more detailed marketing measurement. This has resulted in increased
          usage of MMM as a way to measure media effectiveness. </p>
        <p>In terms of which one to pick, I would be guided by two questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>What&#39;s my largest Media spend</strong>? If its Google then Meridian will be easier to
            integrate or if spending on Meta then go with Robyn </li>
          <li>Do you have a preference on Bayesian vs. Ridge regression models? We <strong>recommend the Bayesian
              modelling of Meridian</strong>. It gives confidence intervals &amp; allows external information - both
            crucial aspects of building a strong model</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lastly, setting up an MMM programme is difficult. As such, teams need to focus on how you take action from
          MMM to make it worthwhile. A crucial use case is through allocating cross-channel budgets or setting your
          budget to hit a target. Whether it&#39;s through Robyn, Meridian or Linea Scenario Tool</p>
        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h3>What other open source MMM tools are there?</h3>
        <p>There are a number of wider free packages available that run different MMM options. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pre-built packages in R or Python</strong>: Are good, but don’t come with the same level of
            functionality and documentation </li>
          <li><strong>PyMC</strong>: A US-focused, well-documented MMM library.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Can I switch between Robyn &amp; Meridian?</h3>
        <p>Whilst you can switch easily between different tools. We wouldn’t recommend switching (on a regular basis)
          due to three things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Domain knowledge makes switching time-consuming </li>
          <li>The speed of updates will (or should) increase if you stick with a modelling structure </li>
          <li>Switching models will cause a difference in outputs. If not managed and explained, this can impact your
            confidence and ability to take action</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Are Robyn &amp; Meridian accurate?</h3>
        <p>Any MMM model is not just a function of the tools used but includes the data quality, the model approach, the
          modeller &amp; how outputs are used. So comparing like-for-like accuracy needs to include all of these
          factors. We recommend two areas to build confidence in accuracy:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Double verification:</strong> If unsure of a result, we set up an experiment to test in more
            detail. Two answers are better than one. </li>
          <li><strong>Out-of-sample testing:</strong> use your model to predict next month&#39;s/quarter&#39;s sales and
            compare accuracy. </li>
          <li><strong>Channel Confidence intervals:</strong> Guides the level of confidence with which you can take
            action. “Tight confidence” then make decisions. “Wide confidence&quot; then needs more data to make a
            decision.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Assuming all of these factors are executed correctly, then an MMM model will be accurate. Here at Linea, <a href="https://linea-analytics.com/scenario-tool-mmm">we
          provide a model review set up</a>. Where we review your modelling framework across:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Modelling structure &amp; KPIs </li>
          <li>Omitted variables </li>
          <li>Possible tests to improve the model </li>
          <li>Benchmark your adstock &amp; diminishing returns </li>
          <li>Key other questions you could answer</li>
        </ul>
