# **Why last click attribution CPA can be misleading** 

Itâ€™s Black Friday. Your CPA drops from Â£/â‚¬ 20 to Â£/â‚¬ 10\.

Have I become a marketing genius? Is the creative suddenly resonating better? Did I finally nail the audience?

Last Click CPA changes are driven by market changes, not media tactics

## Were there just more people in-market to buy?

Thatâ€™s the trap. Too often, teams judge marketing performance by last-click CPA. But often last-click attribution reflects *purchase behavior*, not *marketing impact*. It gives credit to the channel closest to the conversion, ignoring everything that built awareness, trust, and intent along the way.

## What drives the wild changes in CPA?

* **We created demand.** Brand, product, or upper-funnel activity did its job before the last click.  
* **Underlying demand increased.** The market itself drove more people to purchase (think Ice cream on a sunny day)

ðŸ“‰ The risk? You undervalue the work that drives demand, and over-invest in the channels that simply close it.

ðŸ“ˆ True marketing impact needs a broader lens. MMM & incrementality testing uncover what really works. Too often, these tools have only been available to Enterprise brands however, Lineaâ€™s measurement tools are allowing Brands of all sizes to run MMM & A/B tests.

Long-term growth comes from an accurate understanding of what's growing your business.
