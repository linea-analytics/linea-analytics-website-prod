# **Should data science or marketing own measurement?**

A few years back, the answer was simple: marketing. 

But in the last 5–10 years, the ownership has often shifted. In many digital-first companies, measurement now sits with data/analytics, often with data science teams.

## What’s good about this shift?

✅ **External ownership builds confidence**. 

When marketing teams are measuring their own effectiveness, there is the *fear,* from other teams, that “marketing teams are marking their own homework”. So, having a finance or data team as the owner of measurement provides an angle for independence

✅ **Greater opportunity to increase trust in measurement.** 

Having a data team, who are experts in many forms of analytics / measurement, as the arbitrator of accuracy helps increase legitimacy and therefore trust in measurement. Teams can use expertise to challenge, develop & improve the measurement.

## And the risks?

➡️ **Over-prioritising numbers over value.** 

One experience that we, at Linea, have witnessed is that as teams focus more on the details, they lose sight of how to use measurement to take action. This should always be at the core of measurement. How are we using it to ensure that we make better marketing decisions

➡️ **Missing the nuance of how marketing really works.** 

This is something that can be learned, but data science teams need to not only understand the analytical techniques but also the marketing implications. Creative changes, cost inflation, new marketing channels. Without an expertise in these topics, what you are measuring is numbers on a spreadsheet, not tactics to be improved.

## The Linea View: measurement should sit with data teams, *but* with one critical condition.

Brands should have a dedicated **marketing measurement expert** embedded in the data team. Their role: build trust, bring marketing context, and make sure measurement drives action.
