        <h1>4 tips for running marketing measurement for FinTechs</h1>
        <p>In the competitive and often volatile FinTech landscape, efficient growth isn&#39;t a luxury, it&#39;s a
          necessity. From BitPanda to HSBC to AuxMoney, we&#39;ve helped diverse brands drive growth through accurate
          marketing measurement. </p>
        <p>In the last 15 years, the focus has shifted away from allocating credit to understanding the incremental
          impact of every marketing pound spent.</p>
        <p>For FinTech marketers looking to scale, move beyond the limitations of last-click data, and leverage the
          power of Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM) and incrementality testing, here are four essential tips.</p>
        <h2>1. What stage of business are you at?</h2>
        <p>The first mistake we see is a misalignment between a FinTech’s core business objective and its measurement
          strategy. Your marketing goals evolve, and your measurement must keep pace.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>Does the stage of your business <strong>impact your marketing goals?</strong></h4>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The first mistake we see is a misalignment between a FinTech’s core business objective and its measurement
          strategy. Your marketing goals evolve, and your measurement must keep pace. </p>

        </figure>
        <p>Whilst they do often relate to the stage of business between startup to growth, to maturity. It is not always
          clear that a more mature business will, for example, focus on ROI</p>
        <ol start="2">
          <li>
            <h4>Does the stage of your business <strong>impact</strong> <strong>the measurement you use?</strong></h4>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>All brands need to evolve their measurement based on your key question. Below are the three core areas that
          each solve specific questions.</p>
        <p>➡️Last touch measurement: Use at £0k -£10k per month<br>Can help you go from Zero to One when you are using
          only one platform</p>
        <p>➡️Incrementality tests: Use at £10k - £50k per month with 1 or 2 channels<br>Can show you what is and isn’t
          working for one media channel </p>
        <p>➡️MMM (Marketing mix Modelling): Use at +£50k per month with 3+ channels<br>Is a great tool for working out
          how channel budgets can be scaled, help you allocate budgets and hit your growth or acquisition targets</p>
        <p>For a more detailed guide, <a href="https://linea-analytics.com/articles/one-tool/article.html">read
            here</a>. Here at Linea, we focus on moving measurement from static MMM to Always-on MMM. This is the key to
          better, faster decision-making. This allows FinTechs to react to market changes and competitor moves
          immediately, not with a delay.</p>
        <h2>2. Data as a strength in a regulated industry. But what to use &amp; when?</h2>
        <p><strong>FinTechs</strong> are inherently data-rich environments. Marketing teams are often <strong>digitally
            native</strong>, with strong technical data science teams handling complex ETL processes. Marketing teams:
          don’t be fearful of your data. Typically, FinTech business are blessed with two big strengths:</p>
        <p>1️⃣<strong>The Data Wealth:</strong> Your advantage lies in a deep understanding of customer product usage
          (app opens, transaction data, feature adoption), which provides powerful signals beyond simple conversions.
        </p>
        <p>2️⃣<strong>The Collaboration Gap:</strong> Strong Data Science teams are a given, but they often need a clear
          framework to bridge the gap between complex models and actionable marketing strategy.</p>
        <p>At Linea, we specialise in translating data science into marketing action:</p>
        <p>➡️<strong>Map Primary Business Questions:</strong> We don&#39;t just model data; we map your core growth
          questions (&quot;How much do we invest in brand vs. performance?&quot;) to the right analytical tools.</p>
        <p>➡️Identifying at which time &amp; through which measurement approach decisions should be made. </p>
        <figure class="p-5">
          <img src="./image-2.png" width="100%" class="rounded">
        </figure>
        <p>We see this as a collaborative exercise between Marketing, Growth &amp; Data teams. But should you use
          in-house or external teams to execute on that? </p>
        <h2>3. Building Trust: Owning marketing measurement vs. using third parties</h2>
        <p>As your marketing spend grows and complexity increases, the challenge moves from a <em>technical</em>
          exercise (getting the numbers) to a <em>strategic</em> one (driving action from the numbers).</p>
        <p>➡️<strong>Early Stage:</strong> Strong internal teams can often manage platform-level measurement (e.g.,
          in-platform reporting).</p>
        <p>➡️<strong>Growth Stage:</strong> When you introduce complexity (multiple channels, brand building, product
          launches), measurement requires more than just technical execution; it requires a clear, action-oriented
          framework and a deep understanding of measurement approaches.</p>
        <p>We strongly recommend bringing in specialist expertise, either as dedicated in-house people or external
          partners, to ensure success.</p>
        <h2>4. Using measurement to drive growth?</h2>
        <p>The most efficient FinTech marketers use measurement not to <em>report</em> on the past, but to
          <em>model</em> the future. Measurement should unequivocally be about driving growth and achieving an efficient
          <strong>CPA</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Unequivocally, you should be using measurement to drive growth</strong>. Especially in the FinTech
          category, where driving an efficient CPA is imperative. </p>
        <p>With that in mind, incrementality tests &amp; marketing mix models should be set up to answer your key
          marketing questions:</p>
        <p>➡️How much do we need to spend to hit customer acquisition targets?</p>
        <p>➡️If we scale spend on this channel what will be the impact on CPA?</p>
        <p>➡️How much should we invest in performance vs. brand marketing?</p>
        <p>These growth questions might not be your current priority, but marketers need to be closely attuned to ensure
          that measurement is completely aligned to track your overall measurement goal. Here at Linea, we build tools
          that allow marketers to focus <a href="https://linea-analytics.com/articles/running-scenarios/article.html">on
            running scenarios that</a> can drive growth.</p>
        <h2>In summary</h2>
        <p>1: Align your measurement with your current business stage<br>2: Map the measurement goals, KPI, timeframe,
          method &amp; actions<br>3. Trust &amp; Expertise: As complexity grows, invest in specialist expertise to move
          beyond basic reporting.<br>4. Focus measurement on driving growth</p>
