        <h1><strong>How to Allocate Your Marketing Budget Across Channels for Maximum ROI</strong></h1>
        <p><em>A curve with an option to overlay promotion and market demand. Creating new curves &amp; an option to
            demonstrate the impact</em></p>
        <p>It&#39;s an age-old question for Marketing, Growth &amp; Finance teams. How do you allocate your budget
          across marketing channels?</p>
        <p>Here at Linea, we recommend a three-step process to successfully achieve this</p>
        <p><strong>Measure➡️Marketing Goals➡️Scenarios</strong> </p>
        <h2><strong>1. Cross-channel Allocation Measurement: You need MMM</strong></h2>
        <p>Whilst here at Linea, we recommend aligning your business question with the right marketing measurement tool.
          The gold standard for cross-channel allocation is Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM). You can <a
            href="https://linea-analytics.com/articles/choosing-right-tool/article.html">see a detailed overview of the
            right measurement tools for you</a>.</p>
        <p>The benefits of a well-built MMM model are two-fold:</p>
        <p>1️⃣Measure ROI/ CPA on a like-for-like basis</p>
        <p>2️⃣Understand the response to advertising at different spend levels. Known as <strong>diminishing returns
            curves.</strong> </p>
        <p>The diminishing returns are the crucial aspect to support your cross-budget allocation. As a marketing
          channel that has a high ROI at a low spend may not be able to support scaling.</p>
        <p>Within your MMM, as you are looking back over a 2-4 year period. You have the data points to better
          understand how differing daily/ weekly levels of spend respond. Typically, as can be seen in the interactive
          chart below, as spending increases, your advertising achieves fewer returns. </p>
        <p>Why does efficiency typically reduce at higher spend levels? This is driven by the age-old terms of reach and
          frequency. More spending means that you are reaching a less targeted audience. Assuming you hit your target
          audience with your first £1. More spending will also mean that you are increasing the number of times you
          “hit” your target audience. As such, higher frequency can mean more waste.</p>
        <h4>How to measure diminishing returns? An Interactive chart</h4>

        <h2><strong>2. Define Your Marketing Goal: From Efficiency to Growth</strong></h2>

                <figure class="p-5">
          <img src="./thumbnail.jpg" alt="mmm portal scenario tool" width="100%" class="rounded">
        </figure>
        <p>A one-size-fits-all approach to budget allocation simply doesn&#39;t work. Your marketing objectives change,
          and your measurement tools should be agile enough to change with them. Here at Linea, we have the
          <strong>Linea Scenario Tool.</strong> </p>
        <p>This offers three core objectives to support any business goal:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A Set Budget:</strong> Ideal for initial planning, this mode allows you to input a fixed budget
            and see the predicted return. It&#39;s the perfect way to draft an initial <strong>media budget
              allocation</strong> and forecast the level of returns your investment will deliver. </li>
          <li><strong>A Target Uplift:</strong> When your focus is on aggressive growth, this option is your go-to.
            Instead of starting with a budget, you set a target for new customers or revenue. The tool then calculates
            the optimal spend and channel mix to hit or exceed your growth targets. This is crucial for answering
            questions like, &quot;What extra customers can my marketing drive?&quot; </li>
          <li><strong>A Desired ROI Level:</strong> This feature is for brands focused on sustainable, profitable
            growth. You can optimise your media plan against a target ROI or CPA, ensuring every customer is acquired
            within a profitable range. It helps you identify exactly how much more you can spend while staying
            profitable.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3. What-If Factors: Improving the accuracy of your budget allocation</h2>
        <p>You have your Diminishing Returns Curves, and you have also set your marketing goal. The next step is to make
          it reflect what is going to happen in the future.</p>
        <p>In our experience at Linea, Marketers should be presenting back a range of scenarios to their wider business.
          Let&#39;s consider two scenarios:</p>
        <p>1️⃣Media cost inflation impact on budget allocation</p>
        <p>This is a crucial factor. Many brands are currently (Q4 2025) seeing high inflation on digital platforms in
          particular on some key search terms &amp; across Meta. </p>
        <p>If you know that Search is going to be 10% more expensive, then effectiveness will reduce by 10%, unless you
          see a change in efficiency. </p>
        <p>So when running a cross-budget allocation, if one channel&#39;s effectiveness is going to reduce, then more
          budget should be allocated to other channels. Try it for yourself below.</p>
        <h4>How to adjust your budget allocation for rising cost inflation? An Interactive chart</h4>
        <p><em><strong>Two charts with two response curves. Search &amp; Meta Video. Allow search inflation to be
              increased/ decreased. Add in a “best budget” at the bottom with a number that highlights how you would
              allocate budget at current vs. “new”</strong></em></p>
        <p>2️⃣External factors influencing Marketing performance</p>
        <p><em>You are a <strong>subscription TV service,</strong> and you have some “big TV shows” about to launch</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>You are a <strong>FinTech</strong> focused on saving &amp; interest rate is likely to go up next
            quarter</em></p>
        <p><em>You are a <strong>Budget Retailer,</strong> and the economy is predicted to be weaker next quarter</em>
        </p>
        <p>In all of these examples, we see a common trend. Marketing effectiveness is different during periods of peak
          market demand or when your product quality changes. As such, your measurement should capture this synergy
          between marketing and external factors.</p>
        <p>At Linea, we capture this synergy effect and which allows for an important </p>
        <h4>How do external factors impact your budget allocation?</h4>

          <div id="optim-syn-widget"></div>

        <p><em><strong>A chart that shows how a media response curve changes when taking into account an improvement in
              external factors. Add in a current vs. “new” budget recommendation based on each.</strong></em></p>
        <p>That is exactly what we allow teams to run in the Linea Scenario Tool. Whether you have already run your MMM,
          use an open source tool or <a href="https://linea-analytics.com/full-service-mmm">if Linea run your MMM</a>
          then this is exactly the type of future facing scenarios that allow you to confidently take action from
          measurement.</p>
