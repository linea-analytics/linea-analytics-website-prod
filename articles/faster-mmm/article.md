# How do you get faster MMM? 

Here at Linea, we are building an Always-on MMM solution. The core element needed to build this is to automate the data connections.

As a measurement expert with over 15 years of experience, I've seen firsthand how a brand's ability to respond to a rapidly changing market is often the difference between success and stagnation. The traditional, slow, and infrequent approach to marketing mix modelling (MMM) simply can't keep up.

To increase this frequency, MMM model builders need to overcome three main barriers. Speeding up:

1. Data collation  
2. Transformation   
3. Validation process.

## Automating the process

At Linea Analytics, we've solved this problem. We've built API connections across all key data areas to automate the entire process:

✅ Connect data   
✅ Add in detailed naming of data  
✅ Automatically update data status  
✅ Validate/ verify data accuracy  
✅ Repeat: Allowing us to refresh next day, week or month

## Not all data can be automated

Now the reality is that not all data streams can be fully automated. We typically find that \~75% of key datasets can be set up with APIs. The last segment is about getting consistent data uploaded to our platform. This can be done via CSVs or custom file uploads. The important thing is setting and keeping a consistent format.

The benefits of increasing this speed are clear:

➡️ Get faster, more frequent insights

➡️ Make more confident decisions

➡️ Respond to market changes in days, not months.

Always on MMM isn't about getting to 100% automation. We streamline the difficult bits so we can focus on helping you take action from measurement.
