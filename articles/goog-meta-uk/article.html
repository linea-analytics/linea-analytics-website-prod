        <h1><strong>Google &amp; Meta receive 61% of UK ad spend. Will their market-leading position continue?</strong>
        </h1>
        <p>Google’s and Meta’s domination of UK ad spend is not matched by the latest IPA TouchPoints survey, showing
          they account for just 42% of our media time. </p>
        <p>In this article, we look at two things</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How did they come to dominate the UK advertising market? </li>
          <li>Will that dominance continue?</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Google &amp; Meta receive 61% of UK media spend, but only up to 42% of time spent on advertising
            platforms</strong></h4>

        </figure>
        <h2>How did they come to dominate the UK advertising market?</h2>
        <p><strong>They grew the market.</strong><br>In 2007, UK marketing spend was £17bn. Today, it’s £42bn. Had it
          simply tracked inflation, we’d be closer to £30bn. So yes, they’ve taken share from traditional channels
          (sorry, newsbrands), but they’ve also expanded the pie. </p>
        <p><strong>They built better products.</strong><br>Historically, ad spend followed attention. Google and Meta
          earned it. With products that were innovative, engaging, and often habit-forming. Search, in particular, was a
          game-changer. Like a modern Yellow Pages, it matched advertising to expressed interest, not just passive time
          spent.</p>
        <p><strong>A data-driven position</strong><br>Why target broad demographics on TV when you can reach specific
          audiences with precision? We handed over our data and they built targeting engines that delivered measurable,
          efficient reach. Marketers could now report on exact customer segments and how many new customers they were
          driving. Even when taking into account incrementality, at Linea, we see Meta &amp; Google products are some of
          the most efficient channels. </p>
        <p><strong>They broadened the market.</strong><br>Google and Meta made advertising more accessible. Meta alone
          has over 10 million active advertisers, many of them small businesses. They didn’t just dominate big brands;
          they gave smaller players a seat at the table.</p>
        <p>All this highlights how Google &amp; Meta dominated the market. </p>
        <h2>Will that dominance continue into the future?</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Moving beyond last-touch measurement</strong><br>The 2010s were driven by the belief that
          marketers could track everything directly. In hindsight, that promise was overstated. Today, brands are
          rightly asking two key questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>How do we measure incremental impact?</em> </li>
          <li><em>Should platforms be measuring the effectiveness of their own ad spend?</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>As the shift towards incremental measurement has accelerated, so too has investment in Google and Meta.
          Suggesting that even under greater scrutiny, these platforms still perform.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Have you heard of AI?</strong><br>There’s been plenty of speculation about how AI could disrupt
          search behaviour. But Google Search still posted 12% revenue growth in Q2. Any change will be gradual. Google
          still owns the brand, the default position in consumers’ minds, and the integration into our daily
          tools.<br>For challengers (like ChatGPT) to gain ground, they’ll need to <em>outperform</em>, <em>rebrand the
            category</em>, and be <em>seamlessly accessible</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>3. The rise of new attention formats</strong><br> Influencers, podcasts, TikTok, and ad-funded models
          on platforms like Spotify and Netflix all present credible threats in the battle for attention and, therefore,
          ad spend.</p>
        <p>Even in an AI-powered world, some things won’t change: people will still <em>watch</em>, <em>listen</em>, and
          <em>read</em>. And advertising will follow those behaviours. The real question is: <strong>who will capture
            that attention best?</strong></p>
        <h2>What next?</h2>
        <p>Whether Google and Meta continue to outperform will be central to the measurement work we do at Linea
          Analytics. What matters most is ensuring that ad spend follows the effectiveness of marketing channels,
          whether that leads to Google, Meta, or emerging platforms.</p>
