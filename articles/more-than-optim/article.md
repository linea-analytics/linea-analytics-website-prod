# **Why might it be worth spending *more* than the “optimal” amount on your marketing?**

A sensible person would say to stop spending when £1 in marketing returns less than £1 in revenue, the so-called “optimal” point. But in some cases, going beyond that can be the smarter, more strategic move.

When overspending on media is the correct decision

## Marketing effectiveness depends on where you are in your journey

Why is this? It’s not one size fits all. Here are three scenarios where overspending can actually make sense:

1. **Winner-takes-most markets: “Monopoly Master”**  
    When speed and dominance matter, being first to scale can be everything. Think Uber, Airbnb, or even emerging VC-backed categories across finance, DTC retail & tech. In these cases, you win first, optimise later.  
2. **Future customer value:**   
    If you don’t yet have a clear view of LTV, or you’ve got upsell opportunities/ products in the pipeline, then acquiring a customer at a short-term loss can drive long-term profitability.   
3. **Defensive strategy: “Park the Bus”**  
    If you’re the incumbent, maintaining market leadership might mean outspending to block competitors and defend share.

Yes, it’s expensive, but *not* winning the market can cost you far more over time.

This is also why our marketing measurement approach is built for flexibility. As your goals shift from growth to profitability, our **LINEA measurement platform** helps you model the right scenarios at the right time to drive your growth.
