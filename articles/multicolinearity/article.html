        <h1><strong>Factoring in measurement from the planning stage</strong></h1>
        <h2><strong>Improve measurement from planning and testing</strong></h2>
        <p>Measurement sits at the heart of modern marketing. Yet one of the biggest limitations to accurate measurement
          is often decided long before any model is built. It happens at the planning stage. The way channel overlaps
          are managed determines what the data will eventually be able to tell us.</p>
        <p>Marketing Mix Modelling can extract a surprising amount of insight from imperfect data, but its accuracy
          improves dramatically when measurement is considered during planning. Collinearity is one of the clearest
          examples of this.</p>
        <h3><strong>How MMM works</strong></h3>
        <p>As a quick reminder, Marketing Mix Models, or econometric models, use historical data to quantify how much
          revenue has been generated by marketing activity and other business drivers. At its core, this technique
          relies on the fluctuations, or <em>variance</em>, in the data. When a spike in sales aligns with a marketing
          campaign going live, we can start estimating ROIs. Therefore, <em>covariance</em>, meaning how two variables
          move together over time, becomes the key to understanding what is really driving performance.
          </p>
          <div id="mmm-widget"></div>
        <h3><strong>Collinearity</strong></h3>
        <p>In simple terms, collinearity happens when two or more variables move together so closely that it becomes
          difficult to separate their individual effects. In statistics, this creates instability in parameter
          estimates. In MMM, it&#39;s hard to understand which channels are really driving outcomes.</p>
        <p>A classic example is when two channels run simultaneously. Imagine paid social and TV campaigns that always
          go live together. From the model&#39;s point of view, these two channels become almost indistinguishable. When
          sales go up, both channels go up. When both channels go down, both sales go down. The model can still assign
          contributions, but it struggles to say confidently how much belongs to each channel individually. Small
          changes in the data can lead to large swings in attribution between the two.</p>
        <p>This is not just a technical problem. It directly affects:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Channel-level ROI </li>
          <li>Budget redistribution decisions </li>
          <li>Scenario planning </li>
          <li>Long-term learning about what actually works</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can have a perfectly built model and still end up with weak answers if the data structure itself is
          highly collinear.</p>
          
          <div id="multicolinearity-widget"></div>
        <h3><strong>The solution: plan for measurability</strong></h3>
        <p>The most effective way to deal with collinearity is not in the modelling phase. It is in the planning phase.
        </p>
        <p>This does not mean re-designing the entire media strategy around experimentation. It means introducing small,
          controlled variations that allow the data to carry more information. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Staggering the start or end of two key channels </li>
          <li>Holding one channel flat while another scales </li>
          <li>Running short, isolated bursts on selected regions or weeks </li>
          <li>Introducing slight asynchrony in always-on activity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These variations break the perfect alignment between channels. Even a handful of clean, non-overlapping
          periods can dramatically improve how well the model separates effects.</p>
        <p>There is often a perceived cost to this kind of planning. Teams worry about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Short-term performance risk </li>
          <li>Operational complexity </li>
          <li>Stakeholder pressure for constant activity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In practice, this cost is negligible compared to the value of the learning. The ability to confidently
          distinguish true channel performance leads to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>More efficient budget allocation </li>
          <li>Stronger optimisation results </li>
          <li>Higher long-term returns </li>
          <li>Better strategic confidence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The key insight is that you do not need a perfect experimental design. You only need enough variation to give
          the model a fighting chance.</p>
        <h3><strong>Why even small changes matter</strong></h3>
        <p>A common misconception is that you need formal geo experiments or large multi-week blackouts to solve
          collinearity. In reality, just a few controlled deviations are often enough.</p>
        <p>If two channels overlap perfectly for 48 weeks of the year but behave differently for 4 weeks, those 4 weeks
          can anchor the entire model. They provide the contrast needed to distinguish effects across the full time
          series.</p>
        <p>This is one of the most powerful ideas in MMM: Small planning decisions can unlock disproportionate
          measurement value.</p>
