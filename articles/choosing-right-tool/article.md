# **The Modern Marketer's Guide: Choosing The Best Marketing Measurement Tools**

Getting into more complex marketing measurement starts with some bad news: No single marketing measurement tool will answer all of your questions. To achieve a complete, high-confidence view of your marketing impact, you need a cohesive strategy.

Here at Linea Analytics, we recommend a simple but powerful principle:

**Your business question \= right tool to measure**

This leaves us with three key questions we need to answer to build an effective measurement strategy.

## **1\. What tools do we use to answer which question?**

The foundation of your strategy is knowing which tool is best suited for your specific objectives.

Table 1: Mapping questions to marketing measurement tools & the pros/cons of each approach

| Business Question | Tool to measure | Strength’s | Weakness |
| ----- | :---: | ----- | ----- |
| Incremental impact of one marketing channel  | **Experiments (A/B or Geo tests)** | Prove the incrementality of one channel (e.g. TV or YouTube, etc.) Run multiple tests to dive deeper “in channel”  | Difficult to control for all factors for accuracy Short-term focused    |
| Optimise tactics within one marketing channel | **Attribution** | Can run detailed in channel tests  | Not incremental Tracking issues causes bias in results |
| Incremental impact across channels. Cross-channel budgeting | **Marketing mix Modelling (MMM)** | Measure long(er) term impacts Incremental & “like-for-like” cross-channel effectiveness Set/ Allocate cross-channel budgets | No detailed in channel results Is statistical, not tracked, which requires other ways to validate  |

In our experience, the best long-term measurement plan requires using multiple tools to answer all questions. 

However, when starting your journey, which approach is right to start with?

**Experiments**: Best if running 1 or 2 channels, and you want to understand what's working  
E.g. How much incremental returns is Meta driving?

**Attribution**: can be used if you want to improve the ROI within a channel.   
E.g. How do we improve Meta ROI? 

**MMM**: Best if running 2+ channels and you want to understand what's working & how to set the budget  
E.g. How do I allocate budget between our marketing channels to hit our target?

Here at Linea, we tailor our measurement solutions to focus on answering your business questions. This moves your measurement tool from focusing on reporting to driving future growth for your brand.

## **2\. When do we make decisions based on each measurement tool?**

With each tool supporting a different frequency of change, we map when to make decisions. 

Whilst each brand & media agency might slightly differ on the frequency, cadence and data signal used. The following shows Linea’s recommendation for what tactics or strategy to adapt at which time point. This template should be set out in your measurement strategy.

Table 2: When to make changes to your marketing plan? 

| Time period | Typical Question to answer | Data signal | Tool to Use |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Daily** | Allocate in-channel between creative & placements  | Platform goals (clicks/ engagements) | Platform Attribution (meta, GA4, Adobe analytic etc) |
| **Weekly**  | Re-allocate in-channel between creative & placements & to products | CPA/ ROAS | Platform Attribution  Experiments |
| **Monthly** | Allocate to the best-performing marketing channels. How do we hit next month's target? | CPA/ ROI | Experiments MMM |
| **Quarterly** | How effective is our overall marketing strategy? How do we plan for next quarter? | Long Term ROI | MMM |

At Linea, we recognise that historically, MMM has been seen as slow and backwards-looking. That's why we built an Always-on MMM approach. This means we can provide faster delivery, reducing time to action and allowing for incremental, focused measurement at the speed of other measurement approaches. 

## **3\. How do you bring different marketing measurement approaches together?**

You have followed the best practice: you have multiple measurement tools and are using each at different times. But you still have a problem… the tools are giving different results\!

We can overcome this friction in two ways:

1. ### Focus on the measurement best placed to answer each question

In section 1, we clearly set out which tool is best for measuring different questions. **Stick to it**. 

* Use each tool tactically to answer a specific question  
* Only use it at the agreed time period/ frequency   
* Agree with wider teams (finance & operations) on which metrics can be shared, fostering a culture where different metrics are accepted for different purposes.

  ### 

2. ### Align approaches (double verification)

While the first approach sounds good on paper. When dashboards start showing different numbers, it can cause friction or nervousness. 

At this point, you can align the approaches. At Linea, we call this **double verification**. It involves:

* Calibrating your attribution results with the holistic view from MMM.  
* Or, using tests to validate the results of your MMM.

This alignment is essential because it:

1. Builds confidence that your measurement is accurate and robust.  
2. Builds a single, trusted number that can be reported to wider teams & stakeholders.

## In summary

It is not true to say that one measurement solution is best placed to answer all your business questions. Brands need to focus on their key questions, and only then can the right combination of marketing measurement tools be selected. A measurement framework that leverages the speed of experiments and the strategic insight of Always-on MMM is the gold standard for driving growth from marketing measurement.
