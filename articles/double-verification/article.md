# **How to build trust in your MMM outputs**

Our measurement partners said the Brand Media ROI was over £2… but our CEO was sceptical. Does that sound familiar?

We hear this all the time when brands have lost trust in their measurement partners. So, how do you build confidence in your MMM results?

At Linea, we focus on two core principles to build trust:

### **1\. Data transparency**

Transparency is the foundation of trust. For us, that means

* Full access to data and outcomes within our platform  
* Clear communication of uncertainty.   
  * Is ROI truly £2… or is it between £1.50 and £2.50?

### **2\. Trust through validation**

MMM is a probabilistic method. By nature, it’s a forecast of the world. The best way to build confidence is to validate results through experiments. Working under the principle that two measurement approaches pointing in the same direction give more confidence to take action. 

Challenges shouldn’t be taken as rejection of the approach, but as opportunities to test, prove and strengthen the model.

### Build confidence, don’t prove you are right

It might sound obvious, but measurement experts sometimes need to lower their ego and raise their transparency, instead of taking critique or criticism negatively. 

The first thought of your measurement team should be to respond “what if we are wrong” and “what further evidence would help build confidence.

This is absolutely critical to the success of any measurement work, not just MMM. The moment that wider teams lose trust of your agency or in-house measurement teams, no action will be taken. That’s why this sits at the core of our values.
