# **Should we build our MMM in-house or use third-party agencies?**

We’ve seen many brands move in-house their media buying, but haven’t seen the same with MMM. 

Why did many brands in-house their media buying? 

✅ Direct access to platforms  
✅ No cost penalties  
✅ Tighter integration of buying \+ data

Given these broader trends, I would have expected measurement to follow the same path. For some teams, it has, yet typically it remains owned by third parties. 

## 4 reasons why MMM has not been in-housed

**1\. Tools to drive growth**  
Third parties have scalable platforms, automation, and benchmarks to help you take value from measurement.  
In-house means bespoke tools can be built, but it takes time, talent, and ongoing investment.

**2\. Avoiding politics**  
MMM touches marketing, finance, analytics and product.  
Third parties act as neutral referees. In-house? The influence of politics can creep in.

**3\. Embedding incremental measurement**  
Running the analysis is only half the job. The bigger challenge? Getting the business to trust and act on the results.  
Third parties often bring credibility and a proven framework for change. In-house teams can do this, but they need to combine technical expertise with strong internal influence, and that is often two different profiles.

**4\. Cost model**  
In-house isn’t always cheaper. You save fees but add salaries, tech, and turnover risk. Vendors spread costs across clients.

## So, will the future of MMM be in-house or with Agencies? 

Firstly, ignore my prediction. 5 years ago, I would have predicted much more in-house take-up. But that reality hasn’t taken hold, and many third-party providers have seen and continue to see significant growth. With a continued demand, I do expect third parties to still be the default.
