# **Whatâ€™s the one marketing measurement tool brands should be using?** 

One question that keeps coming up. It's such a shame that this question still comes up because there is no magic bullet.

There *is* one principle we would recommend:

## ðŸŽ¯ Right business questions right tool

For most companies, that means a measurement approach that connects marketing to revenue:

âœ… One marketing channel incremental testing? Use an A/B test

âœ… In channel optimisation? In platform attribution tools can use support this

âœ… Cross channel incremental testing? Use an MMM model

âœ… Which creative/ campaign is performing best? It depends on in-channel vs. Cross-channel or qualitative research (survey) can be helpful. 

## And as the marketing landscape continues to fragment this isnâ€™t going to get any easier. 

Marketers have been trained to think that there is one tool that can rule them all. But your measurement is only as good as your setup, your goals, and your desire to stick to the marketing measurement framework you set up.
